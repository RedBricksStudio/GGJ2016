Global Game Jam 2016 Red Bricks Studio
======================================

What is this?
-------------
This is the repository where the game by Red Bricks Studio done for the 
[Global Game Jam 2016] will reside.

Why doesn't it has a name?
--------------------------
Probably we haven't yet thinked of one, or we didn't have time to put it
here, or probably another justifiable reason, nevertheless that should
change very soon.

Who are Red Bricks Studio?
--------------------------
Red Bricks Studio is just a few friends (some of which are artists, some of 
which are programmers) that get together and participate in Game Jams

So far we have only participated in the 34th [Ludum Dare], as a result of 
that we created [Where are meow friends], a game about cats and dogs, is kinda 
cool I guess, you should play it if you like cats or stuff.
